# Differential networks and visual attention for fake news detection

Multimodal deep learning involves extracting features from different modes of data like text and images and combining these signals in an effective way to make a prediction. The part where features are combined is a challenging task and is not as straightforward as concatenating the features or doing a simple dot product of features obtained from the text and image.

There was a paper published in AAAI 2019 for Visual Question Answering which is also a multimodal task where a question is asked and we try to answer it by looking at both the image and question. Here they proposed replacing fully connected neural networks with something called differential networks.
