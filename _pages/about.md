I'm a sophomore at BITS Goa pursuing Electronics and Communications.
My interests lie in Deep learning and NLP. I'm currently exploring the world of multimodal deep learning
and malware classification using Computer Vision. 
Also working on building a library for adversarial NLP to check robustness of NLP models.
